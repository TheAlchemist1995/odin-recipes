The objective of the current project is to create a simple recipe website using the basic HTML skills I have acquired thus far. Upon completion of the website, I will have demonstrated my ability to;
  - Successfully code the HTML boilerplate.
  - Make use of ordered and unordered lists, and nested lists where required.
  - Incorporate webpage links and images using both relative and absolute pathways.
  - Use the command line to manage the creation, deletion, and movement of files and directories.
  - Ensure that tags are used appropriately.
  - Implement tag attributes to alter the behaviour of HTML tags.
  - Understand how to use commits successfully.
