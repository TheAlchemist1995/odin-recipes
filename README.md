The objective of the current project is to create a simple recipe website using the basic HTML skills I have acquired thus far. Upon completion of the website, I will have demonstrated my ability to;
  - Successfully code the HTML boilerplate.
  - Make use of ordered and unordered lists, and nested lists where required.
  - Incorporate webpage links and images using both relative and absolute pathways.
  - Use the command line to manage the creation, deletion, and movement of files and directories.
  - Ensure that tags are used appropriately.
  - Implement tag attributes to alter the behaviour of HTML tags.
  - Understand how to use commits successfully.

Notes along the way to project completion:
  - Forgot to add 'target' attribute to "<a></a>" tags despite entering 'rel="noopener noreferrer"'. Remember, 'target' attribute is necessary to open a new tab. 'rel="noopener noreferrer"' are implemented only for security purpose and after 'target' is present.
  - I attempted to create fractions with <sup> and <sub> elements. Whilst this worked to an extent, the format of the fractions on the loaded webpage looked awful. "&frasl;" can be used to produce a better fraction line between the <sup> and <sub> elements. For instance, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> to produce a half.
  - As I'm progressing through the webpages, it's clear to me that the pages themselves look stylistically weak. Advanced html and css styling is evidently required.
  - I became lazy with recipe steps and simply copied from the recipe website. Content isn't as important to structure of the webpage at this stage. Focused more on the HTML syntax.

Review: Overall, I met most of the objectives listed above, with the exception of nesting lists (wasn't required to my knowledge). I did have to refer back to Git lessons to ensure I staged and committed properly, before pushing the final project to the remote repository on GitHub. Moreover, I picked up the &frasl; function along the way. The project became a bit repetitive towards the end, but I'm now confident with very basic HTML. My project pushed to GitHub requires a considerable transformation regarding style and layout.
