The objective of the current project is to create a simple recipe website using the basic HTML skills I have acquired thus far. Upon completion of the website, I will have demonstrated my ability to;
  - Successfully code the HTML boilerplate.
  - Make use of ordered and unordered lists, and nested lists where required.
  - Incorporate webpage links and images using both relative and absolute pathways.
  - Use the command line to manage the creation, deletion, and movement of files and directories.
  - Ensure that tags are used appropriately.
  - Implement tag attributes to alter the behaviour of HTML tags.
  - Understand how to use commits successfully.

Notes along the way to project completion:
  - Forgot to add 'target' attribute to <a></a> tags despite entering 'rel="noopener noreferrer"'. Remember, 'target' attribute is necessary to open a new tab. 'rel="noopener noreferrer"' are implemented only for security purpose and after 'target' is present.
  - I attempted to create fractions with <sup> and <sub> elements. Whilst this worked to an extent, the format of the fractions on the loaded webpage looked awful. &frasl; can be used to produce a better fraction line between the <sup> and <sub> elements. For instance, <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> to produce a half.
